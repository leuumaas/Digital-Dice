# Digital-Dice
This project involves designing a digital dice display system using a 3x3 grid of LEDs (A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, J) and utilizing only NAND gates to achieve the desired logic. The display corresponds to a 4-bit binary input, with each combination lighting up specific LEDs to represent different dice patterns
